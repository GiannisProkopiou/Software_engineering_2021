# T&D (Track and Deliver) :incoming_envelope:

**Introduction:**

In the course of Software Engineering in the department of Computer Engineering and Informatics we were asked to implement a non-existent software.
So after discussions about the type of software and its wider use we created the following application.

**Information about the application:**

Track and Deliver (T&D) is a desktop application aiming to simplify postal services between Courier companies and customers. The application has 3 aspects: Individual, Company, and Distributor. The purpose of the applicationÂ is to keep track of multiple user's orders (providing the tracking number).In the event of a subscription, users are able to assign packages to be collected from distinct courier companies by distributors.
